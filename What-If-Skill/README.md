## What the Skill Will Do
It's a simple yet engaging skill. It will ask you amusing questions which can even help to start a conversation with your friends. Some questions are quite a thinker so you can pause the game at any point in time or just stop and return back to the same question where you have left. And once you give your answer in the form of a "yes" or "no", you can see how many of the people think like you.

Your users will be able to say things like:

This will begin a new Alexa skill session.

Alexa will begin a new session and ask you what if kind of questions:

*  "Welcome back! To begin with the game say begin"
*  Reply: _"begin" to start the game or "stop" to end the game._
*  "What if Pokemon is for real but all the normal animals are extinct"
*  Reply: _No_
*  "Booya! 60% of the people think just like you Isn't that amazing?"
