#Entry for Alexa April Life Hack Skill Challenge

Get a new compliment each morning!
Have a good start with Alexa giving you a compliment. 
If you like the compliment and want to share it with everybody on twitter?

Just ask Alexa to tweet it!
"Alexa, ask good morning to tweet it"

Or what if you wanna tag a friend to the compliment? 
You can ask Alexa to do that as well!

User: "Alexa, ask good morning to add a friend"
Alexa: "Do you wanna add a friend?"
User: "Yes"
Alexa: "Tell me the first name of your friend"
User: "Tag (First name of your friend)"
Alexa: "Do you wanna tag (Full name of your friend)"
User: "Yes"
Alexa: "I have posted the status on twitter!"
